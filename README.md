Task-1: Develop a tool to assess the strength of passwords entered by users. Implement
algorithms to analyze factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness to provide
feedback on password strength.
Objective: The objective of developing a tool to assess the strength of passwords entered by users is to enhance security by ensuring that users create strong, resilient passwords. This tool will implement algorithms to analyze various factors of the password, such as length, complexity, and uniqueness, and will provide users with feedback on their password strength. 

Overview: The goal is to develop a tool that evaluates the strength of passwords entered by users. The tool will implement algorithms to analyze various aspects of the password, such as length, complexity, and uniqueness. Based on this analysis, it will provide feedback to help users create stronger passwords.

Conclusion: Developing a tool to assess the strength of passwords entered by users is an essential step towards enhancing digital security. By implementing algorithms that analyze factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness, the tool provides comprehensive feedback that helps users understand the robustness of their passwords. This, in turn, encourages the adoption of stronger passwords, thereby reducing vulnerabilities and protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.
