Task-1: Develop a tool to assess the strength of passwords entered by users. Implement
algorithms to analyze factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness to provide
feedback on password strength.

Objective: The objective of developing a tool to assess the strength of passwords entered by users is to enhance security by ensuring that users create strong, resilient passwords. This tool will implement algorithms to analyze various factors of the password, such as length, complexity, and uniqueness, and will provide users with feedback on their password strength. 

Overview: The goal is to develop a tool that evaluates the strength of passwords entered by users. The tool will implement algorithms to analyze various aspects of the password, such as length, complexity, and uniqueness. Based on this analysis, it will provide feedback to help users create stronger passwords.

Conclusion: Developing a tool to assess the strength of passwords entered by users is an essential step towards enhancing digital security. By implementing algorithms that analyze factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness, the tool provides comprehensive feedback that helps users understand the robustness of their passwords. This, in turn, encourages the adoption of stronger passwords, thereby reducing vulnerabilities and protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.

Task-2: Create a simple vulnerability scanning tool that scans a network or website
for common security vulnerabilities such as open ports, outdated software
versions, and misconfigurations.  

Objective: The objective of creating a simple vulnerability scanning tool is to enhance network and web application security by identifying common security vulnerabilities. This tool aims to scan networks or websites for issues such as open ports, outdated software versions, and misconfigurations. By detecting these vulnerabilities, the tool helps administrators and security professionals proactively address potential security threats, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and other cyber attacks.

Overview: Creating a simple vulnerability scanning tool is an essential initiative to bolster network and web application security. This tool will scan networks or websites for common security vulnerabilities such as open ports, outdated software versions, and misconfigurations. By identifying these vulnerabilities, the tool aims to help administrators and security professionals take proactive measures to protect their systems from potential cyber threats.

Conclusion: Creating a simple vulnerability scanning tool that scans a network or website for common security vulnerabilities such as open ports, outdated software versions, and misconfigurations is a crucial step in enhancing cybersecurity. This tool helps identify potential entry points and weaknesses that attackers could exploit, enabling administrators and security professionals to proactively address these issues.
